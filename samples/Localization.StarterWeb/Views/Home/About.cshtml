@using Microsoft.AspNet.Mvc.Localization

@* The IViewLocalizer can be injected into the view. It does two things of interest:
     1. It HTML encodes *parameters* passed to resource strings (not the resource strings themselves, as they may contain
        HTML) automatically, and returns the result as an HtmlString so Razor won't HTML encode it again;
     2. It looks for localization resources for this view based on the view path, e.g. if the view's path is
        "/Views/Home/About.cshtml", then the corresponding resource base path will be "Views.Home.About.cshtml" *@

@inject IViewLocalizer Localizer

@{
    ViewData["Title"] = Localizer["About"];
}
<h2>@ViewData["Title"].</h2>
<h3>@ViewData["Message"]</h3>
